# Ziron API scripts

A selection of scripts for working with the [Ziron](https://www.ziron.com/) [API](https://zironuk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/524317/Overview).

Ziron are a voice and messaging provider, based in the UK offering SIP termination / trunk services. I am not affiliated with them, I'm just a customer.
